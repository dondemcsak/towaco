Towaco - Intro to Infrastructure as Code

# Introduction

The intent of this project is to get up and running using Infrastructure as Code principles.  In order to easily create and destroy your Infrastructure, you are going to need a place where you can easily spin up resources, and then destroy them.  While some people might be able to have a lab at home with plenty of compute, network, and storage, most will not.  Thankfully there are a number of inexpensive Cloud Providers that you can use as a lab environment.  We will start with Azure, and eventually (hopefully) use the same principles with some other Cloud Providers.
